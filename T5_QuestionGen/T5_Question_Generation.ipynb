        "Evaluating a language generation model is a little more complicated than evaluating something like a classification model. This is because there is no right answer you can compare against like you could with a classification model. The evaluation dataset contains descriptions and the questions that people have asked about those products, but that doesn’t mean that those are the only right questions you can ask.\n",
